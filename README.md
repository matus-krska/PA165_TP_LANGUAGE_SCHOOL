# PA165_TP_LANGUAGE_SCHOOL
Team project for course PA165 of FI, Masaryk University

General Requirement:
Create a system for language school lectures management. Each lecture can take place in a given day and time, and is related to 
some course. The course is defined by its (unique) name, language and proficiency level. 
However, each lecture will be independent. That means that each lecture can have different topic, it can be given by different 
lecturer and arbitrary number of students can enroll in it. 
Each lecturer will have name, surname, and record of taught languages. 
In addition, the lecturer will have indication that he/she is a native speaker.

1st milestone:
Project Requirements:

    create a project in a Github repository that is publicly accessible (for read) choose a short and descriptive name. Create some project wiki to publish other information for your project.
    on the project wiki there will be a project description, a use case diagram and a class diagram for entity classes. There will be at least two user roles in the use case diagram. Associations between entities will be present in the class diagram.  
    create 4 entity classes for your project.
    create a DAO layer interface (with proper javadoc).
    create the JPA implementation of the DAO classes (CRUD operations are enough for the first checkpoint).
    create unit tests for DAO classes (use in-memory database).
    every team member should work with different entities on different parts of the project (e.g. member 1 will create implementation of DAO for entity A, but member 2 will create unit test for entity A). In every class there will  be javadoc @author with the name of the class author. Also you must commit into Git only the changes that you made yourself. If you commit on behalf of somebody else this will not be regarded as his work!
    the project will be built using maven, and make sure you have all dependencies correctly configured, so it is possible to build it using just the command line.
